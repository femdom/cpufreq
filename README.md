# Rust bindings for cpufreq library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/femdom/cpufreq.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/femdom/cpufreq)

## Brief description

This is simple rust class based interface to the cpufreq library. It's far from being perfect, but still usable.
It's unittested on the real system with real libcpufreq and with a mock library.

## Requirements

To build cpupower rust library you need either libcpupower or libcpufreq and rust 1.2.0 or higher.
